# Uncertainty-Quantification

My solutions for MA 540: Uncertainty Quantification offered by NCSU.

This topics covers the following topics:
  * Determine the sources and impacts of input and response uncertainties in models arising in their discipline as well as prototypical weather, climate, hydrology, nuclear and biology models.
  * Explain the basic probability, stochastic process and statistics concepts required for uncertainty quantification.
  * Formulate models in a manner that isolates the influential parameters and facilitates statistical analysis. This includes the use of local and global sensitivity analysis techniques.
  * Construct surrogate models for complex processes that retain the fundamental underlying behavior while providing the computational efficiency required for model calibration and uncertainty propagation.
  * Compute confidence intervals using frequentist analysis and employ Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to construct posterior distributions and credible intervals for parameters. Be able to verify the accuracy of distributions constructed using Bayesian analysis.
  * Compute confidence, credible and prediction intervals for model responses and quantities of interest using sampling techniques and numerical stochastic spectral methods.
  
 [Project 1](https://github.com/TZhoroev/Uncertainty-Quantification/tree/main/Project%201): 
 
  - Learned the various methods, including analytical, finite difference, and complex-step approximations, to compute the sensitivity equations of the models with respect to each parameter of the model. 
  - Creating and employing the Fisher (information) matrix to perform local sensitivity analysis and identify an identifiable subset of parameters. 
  - Studied different statistical distances to compare the distributions. 
  - Covered different algorithm to perform global sensitivity analysis to the model.
